# Data Hub Documentation

The documentation is written in Markdown and served as static HTML with [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/).

## Editing content

Run `$ npm install` to install dependencies and then run `$ npm run docs:dev` to start the local development server. You can now edit the Markdown files. The content in website will refresh automatically.
