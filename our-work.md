# Our work

## Data Hub Use Cases

The **Data Hub** framework is designed to adapt to various geographical contexts. The following examples highlight its core concept and features. Our mission is to make a wide range of use cases openly accessible.

        {text: 'Ghana Data Hub Demo', href: 'https://demo.datasnack.org/'},
    ]"
>

We are collaborating on various projects with international research partners to co-develop a **Ghana Data Hub**. Its main focus is on implementing research projects and support capacity exchange in the areas of Global Health, with an emphasis on the detection, control, prevention, and study of (zoonotic) infectious diseases. The Data Hub serves as a data collaboration platform, interoperable with common data collection tools (*REDCap*) and analysis software (*R* and *Python*).

In addition to project-specific Data Hub frameworks, we have developed a publicly accessible **Ghana Demo Data Hub** that demonstrates its core functionalities. The Demo Hub exclusively integrates open data informed by data needs arising from Global Health research, action and training. We are continuously working on updates to the core framework, new and improved features, and additional data layers.

In cooperation with partners from Germany and Costa Rica, we are co-developing a **Costa Rica Data Hub**, including new features, to support collaborative research on climate change and bacterial diseases, including antimicrobial resistance, as part of the *German-Costa Rican Center for Climate Adaptation and Infectious Diseases* (GC-ADAPT), funded by *German Federal Ministry of Education, Research and Space* (BMFTR).

    title="🇩🇪 Public Health Risk Assessment in Germany, Europe"
    :links="[

Driven by the demands of public health risk epidemiology, we are co-developing a **Germany Data Hub**, including new features, designed to support automated assessment of epidemic risks and impacts (*FRED - Frühwarnsystem zur Bewertung epidemischer Bedrohungslagen in Deutschland*). The Data Hub will be part of a pipeline that links disease data with contextual information to facilitates data analysis and risk assessment using *STATA*, funded by *German Federal Ministry of Education, Research and Space* (BMFTR/DATI).

The development of the Data Hub framework originated from a research collaboration between Germany and Tanzania aimed at strengthening Epidemiological Surveillance for Infectious Diseases in Sub-Saharan Africa (ESIDA), funded by *German Federal Ministry of Education and Research* (BMBF/BMFTR). A **Tanzania Data Hub** was developed as a platform for data collaboration, linking outbreak data, epidemiological context data (covariates), and analytical software for epidemiological risk assessment.

As part of the *NASA Lifelines simulation exercise* exploring the application of diverse data inputs (especially earths observation data) for humanitarian action, we established a **Democratic Republic of the Congo Data Hub**. Acting as a technical unit, our mission was to address humanitarian information needs and collaboratively tackle real-world crisis scenarios alongside a multidisciplinary expert team.

## Facilitating Data-Driven Collaborative Research

Alongside software development, we aim to enhance the capacity of research teams (and beyond) through workshops and training initiatives that promote data collaboration.

<Teaser 
    title="FAIR Data Principles and Research Software Engineering"
    :links="[
    ]"
>

To strengthen data-driven and effective collaborative research, a solid foundation of good data practices and software development is essential. We aim to build these capacities through workshops on the concepts and practical approaches of FAIR Research Data principles, FAIR research software engineering, Open Science practices (e.g., open licenses for data and software), and an open technical ecosystem for research, mainly in the context of Global Health.

    :links="[
		{text: 'Visit WHO Collaborative Surveillance framework', href: 'https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240074064'},
    ]"
>

At **Data Snack**, we engage with diverse stakeholders to explore the technical ecosystem that supports the entire data lifecycle within Global Health, guided by the *WHO's framework of Collaborative Surveillance*. This activity focuses on tools for (i) field data collection, (ii) data processing, harmonization, and storage, (iii) data exploration, analysis, and collaboration, as well as (iv) the management, dissemination, and visualization of information derived from these data.

Embracing this framework, we support (postgraduate) training initiatives through our expertise, including the Master's program *Public Health* at HAW Hamburg and the Short Course *Epidemiology & Control of Diseases in Outbreak Settings* (EPICID) at BNITM. Our focus is on open-source tools and datasets that are easily accessible and recognized as good practices in our target field.

## Gamification in Global Health Education

We collaborate with the **[Interdisciplinary Academy of Competence & Education for Global Health](https://www.bnitm.de/en/training/zentrum-fuer-fort-und-weiterbildung/iace)** (BNITM) and external software developers specializing in digital games, and mixed reality to design applications for training and capacity exchange in Global Health.

**Our contributions include**
- crafting narrative designs
- supporting the development of gamification concepts, working closely with developers
- overseeing testing, implementation and dissemination
