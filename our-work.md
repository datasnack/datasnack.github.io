# Our work


## Data Hub framework

The **Data Hub** framework is designed to adapt to various geographical contexts. The following examples highlight its core concept and features. Our mission is to make a wide range of use cases openly accessible to all interested users.

>

We are collaborating on various projects with international research partners to co-develop a Ghana Data Hub. Its primary focus is on implementing research projects and support capacity exchange in the areas of Global Health, with an emphasis on the detection, control, prevention, and study of (zoonotic) infectious diseases. The Data Hub serves as a data repository and platform for data collaboration, interoperable with common data collection tools ([REDCap](https://project-redcap.org/)) and analysis software ([R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/)).

- Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine (GER)
- Charit√© - University Medicine Berlin (GER)

While project-specific Data Hub systems on Ghana are utilized and supported individually by the project teams, we have developed a publicly accessible Demo Hub that demonstrates the functionalities of the framework and offers a space for self-discovery. The Demo Hub exclusively integrates open data informed by data needs arising from Global Health research, action and training. We are continuously working on updates to the core framework, new/improved features, and additional data layers.

In cooperation with partners from Germany and Costa Rica, we are co-developing a Data Hub, including new features, to support data collaboration and research on climate change and antimicrobial resistance in Costa Rica as part of the new "German-Costa Rican Center for Climate Adaptation and Infectious Diseases" (GC-ADAPT), funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF). This project leverages Costa Rica‚Äôs unique characteristics as an ideal use case, given its diverse climate zones condensed into a small geographical area.

**Collaborating partners:**
- Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine (GER)
- Instituto Costarricense de Investigaci√≥n y Ense√±anza en Nutrici√≥n y Salud (CRI)
- Universidad de Costa Rica (CRI)
- Universidad Nacional (CRI)
- University of Hamburg (GER)

Driven by the demands of risk epidemiology and public health, we are co-developing a Data Hub for Germany, including new features, designed to support automated assessment of outbreak risks and impacts (FRED "Fr√ºhwarnsystem zur Bewertung epidemischer Bedrohungslagen in Deutschland"). The Data Hub will be part of a pipeline that links outbreak data with contextual information (covariates) to facilitates data analysis and risk assessment using [STATA](https://www.stata.com/).

As part of a [NASA Lifelines simulation exercise](https://nasalifelines.org/programs/simulations/) exploring the application of diverse data inputs (especially satellite data) for humanitarian action, we established a Data Hub framework for the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Acting as a Technical Unit, our mission was to address critical humanitarian information needs and collaboratively tackle a real-world crisis scenario alongside a multidisciplinary team of experts.

The development of the Data Hub framework originated from a research collaboration between Germany and Tanzania aimed at strengthening [Epidemiological Surveillance for Infectious Diseases in sub-Saharan Africa (ESIDA)](https://zenodo.org/records/7322396), funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF). The Data Hub was designed and developed as a central platform for data collaboration, linking outbreak data, epidemiological context data (covariates), and analytical software for epidemiological risk assessment.

## Data Collaboration

### Digital Ecosystem for Collaborative Public Health Intelligence

At Data Snack, we engage with diverse stakeholders to map a technical ecosystem that effectively supports the entire data lifecycle within Global Health research and action, guided by the [WHO's concept of Collaborative Surveillance](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240074064). This activity focuses on tools for (i) field data collection (both quantitative and qualitative), (ii) data processing, harmonization, and storage, (iii) data exploration, analysis, and collaboration, as well as (iv) the management, dissemination, and visualization of information derived from these data.

Our focus is on open-source tools and datasets that are easily accessible and recognized as best practices in our target field. Our ultimate aim is to position the **Data Hub framework** as a potential open-source solution within this ecosystem, providing a scalable and sustainable data architecture.


### Training in Data Collaboration

Alongside software design and development, we aim to enhance the capacity of research teams (and beyond) through workshops and training initiatives that promote effective data collaboration. This involves exploring open data and open-source software solutions, adopting [FAIR data principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/), utilizing open data and software licensing models, fostering collaboration on data and coding projects, and embracing open science practices.

In the future, we plan to assist project teams in establishing essential frameworks for data collaboration, including creating data sharing frameworks, addressing challenges in data exchange, and tackling ethical considerations related to data partnerships.


## Gamification in Global Health teaching and capacity exchange

We are collaborating with the [Interdisciplinary Academy of Competence & Education for Global Health](https://www.bnitm.de/en/training/zentrum-fuer-fort-und-weiterbildung/iace) at the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine and external software developers specializing in digital games and mixed reality to design applications for applied training and capacity exchange in Global Health. Our primary focus is on outbreak response, preparedness, and prevention. Our contributions include crafting narrative designs, supporting the development of gamification concepts, working closely with developers to create software applications, and overseeing the testing, implementation and transfer into practice of these educational tools.
